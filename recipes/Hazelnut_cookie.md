## Preparation

1. Toast hazelnuts in a shallow baking pan until skins begin to loosen, about 6 minutes. Rub nuts in a kitchen towel to remove any loose skins (some skins may not come off) and cool to room temperature.

2. Pulse nuts and ¼ cup sugar in a food processor until nuts are finely ground, then add flour and a pinch of salt, pulsing until combined.

3. Add butter and pulse until dough just forms a ball.

4. Divide dough in half, then roll dough on a work surface lightly dusted with sugar and flour into 2 (28cm long) logs (each about 2,5cm wide). Chill, wrapped in aluminum wrap, for 1 hour.

5. Cut logs crosswise into 1,25cm slices and arrange rounds 5 cm apart on 2 baking sheets lined with parchment paper or silicone mat. Bake, 1 sheet at a time in the oven at 180°C for about 12-15 minutes or until bottom edges just begin to turn pale golden.

6. Leave the cookies to cool for about 2 minutes. Place remaining 3 tablespoons of sugar in a small dish and dip tops of cookies in it. Let them cool completely.

*Easy suggestion:*

Dough can be chilled up to 12 hours or frozen, wrapped well in plastic wrap, up to 1 month. (Thaw before cutting and baking.)

Cookies keep in an airtight container at room temperature for 2 weeks.
